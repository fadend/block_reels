This Chrome extension uses a crude method for blocking Reels on Facebook content.

It's not available in the Chrome Web Store so you'll need to load the unpacked version, starting
from chrome://extensions.

There are already existing extensions that do this, probably in a nicer way, but I'm
generally scared of installing 3rd party extensions.
